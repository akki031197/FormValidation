# FormValidation

This project demonstrates a simple form validation implementation in JavaScript. It validates the user's input for username, email address, password, and password confirmation fields.

## Features
- **Username validation:** Checks if the username is between 3 and 20 characters long, allowing only alphanumeric characters (letters A-Z, numbers 0-9), and underscores.
- **Email address validation:** Ensures that the email address follows the standard format, including an "@" symbol, a domain name, and a valid domain extension.
- **Password validation:** Verifies that the password is at least 8 characters long, containing a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Password confirmation:** Compares the password entered in the confirmation field with the original password to ensure they match.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Provides the structure and elements of the form.
- CSS: Adds basic styling to the form elements and validation messages.
- JavaScript: Implements the form validation logic.

## Usage
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory and navigate to the `index.html` file.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser of your choice.
4. Fill in the form fields as follows:
   - **Username:** Enter a username between 3 and 20 characters, using only letters, numbers, and underscores.
   - **Email:** Input a valid email address.
   - **Password:** Provide a password that meets the complexity requirements (at least 8 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters).
   - **Confirm Password:** Enter the same password as above to confirm.
5. Submit the form by clicking the "Submit" button.
6. If there are any validation errors, error messages will be displayed next to the corresponding form fields.
7. If all fields are valid, a success message will be shown.

## Customization
You can customize the form validation rules by modifying the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file. Update the regular expressions and validation conditions according to your specific requirements.

Additionally, you can customize the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file to match the desired look and feel of the form and validation messages.
